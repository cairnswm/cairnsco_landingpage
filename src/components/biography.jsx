        <p>
          I am a passionate software engineer and team lead with 28 years of
          experience as a solution architect and in software development,
          including 13 years of leading software engineering teams. A love of
          software development has resulted in a focus on engineering skills,
          especially Software Engineering on the Cloud. Many years of defining
          application architectures and implementing development best practices
          in engineering teams have shaped my journey.

          The day my father brought home a computer, I was hooked (grade 7). He
          introduced me to the basics of programming and soon supplied books
          that taught me further. Being able to make simple games my brothers
          could play was the greatest fun I could have.

          When it came to choosing a career, the only job I could see myself
          doing for the rest of my life was being a software developer. I,
          therefore, studied both Information Systems and Computer Science
          during my university degree. The computer labs were my second home,
          either writing my own code or helping others with their homework (it
          is also where I met my wife).
        </p>
        <p>
          As I get older I find that I still love the art of programming, the
          endless learning and new ideas to try make it a career that will never
          stagnate. I hold a Masters degree in Software Engineering and love
          teaching others to program and follow modern practices such as unit
          testing, agile methodologies, and cloud development. I bring a
          positive attitude to all teams I work with and dedicate significant
          time to mentoring junior developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in serving as a Technical Lead on development projects. I
          enjoy working with various technologies, and currently, I am excited
          about using React with micro-frontends through singlespa.

          I have fallen in love with AI Software development using a bolt.new,
          bolt.diy, cline, and ChatGPT to assist me in developoing software. The
          more I work with AI the more I see the potential that AI has to
          enhance the productivity I have in developing software.
